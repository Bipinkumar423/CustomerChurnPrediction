Customer Churn Prediction – Detailed Project Report
Problem Statement
In today’s competitive business environment, customer loyalty plays a vital role in ensuring sustainable growth. However, customer churn—when users discontinue their subscription or switch to competitors—remains a major challenge. Churn not only reduces revenue but also increases the cost of acquiring new customers.

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning-based predictive model that identifies customers most at risk of churning. By leveraging historical customer data—such as demographic details, subscription history, billing information, and usage patterns—the model enables businesses to proactively engage with high-risk customers. The solution supports data-driven retention strategies, helping organizations strengthen customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and enhance long-term profitability.

Data Description
The dataset consists of customer information with the following attributes:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Name: Customer’s name.

Age: Age of the customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

Location: City of the customer (Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York).

Subscription_Length_Months: Duration of the subscription in months.

Monthly_Bill: Monthly payment amount.

Total_Usage_GB: Internet/data usage in gigabytes.

Churn: Target variable (1 = churned, 0 = not churned).

This data provides both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for applying a wide range of machine learning algorithms.

Technologies and Tools Used
Programming & Environment

Python: Core language for data analysis and modeling.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive platform for exploration and documentation.

Libraries for Data Handling & Visualization

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation, transformation, and numerical computation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through charts and visualizations.

Machine Learning Frameworks

Scikit-learn: Provides classification algorithms, preprocessing methods, and model evaluation techniques.

TensorFlow & Keras: For building, training, and fine-tuning deep learning models.

Algorithms Implemented

Classical models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes.

Ensemble methods: Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.

Deep learning: Neural Networks for capturing complex data patterns.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

StandardScaler: Standardization of numerical features.

One-Hot Encoding: Encoding categorical variables.

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): Identifying multicollinearity.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction for improved efficiency.

Model Optimization

Cross-Validation: Ensures generalization and prevents overfitting.

GridSearchCV: Exhaustive search for best hyperparameters.

Early Stopping & ModelCheckpoint: Regularization techniques for deep learning.

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Confusion Matrix for error analysis.

ROC Curve and AUC for classification performance.

Outcome
The final outcome of this project is a predictive churn model capable of classifying customers into churn and non-churn categories with high accuracy. By analyzing features such as age, subscription length, billing patterns, and usage, the model highlights customers who are most likely to leave.

This enables organizations to:

Take proactive actions (special offers, personalized support) for high-risk customers.

Optimize marketing spend by focusing resources where they matter most.

Improve retention strategies, thereby increasing customer lifetime value.

Enhance overall customer satisfaction through data-driven personalization.

In conclusion, this project transforms raw customer data into a strategic decision-making tool, empowering businesses to minimize churn, strengthen relationships, and achieve sustainable growth.
